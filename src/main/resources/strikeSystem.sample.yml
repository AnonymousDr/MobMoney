# With this file, you can configure your own Strike System. This allows you to give more money, and/or execute commands
# when a condition is accomplished. In every line, you will find an explanation of what it does.
# IMPORTANT: To make this to work, the file has to have the following name: strikeSystem.yml
ALL: # Affects ALL entities, including specifically configured ones
  maxTime: 5000 # Time in miliseconds, 5000 is 5 seconds. When the user kills another entity in that amount of time, time gets renew'd
  messagingSample: # This name is just an example, you can rename 'messagingSample' however you'd like
    minRequired: 2 # Minimum amount of mobs required to start the strike combo. 2 means it would start at the second entity of the same type killed in the span of 'maxTime'
    commands:
      msgSample: # Again, this name is just an example, you can rename 'msgSample' however you'd like
        command: "msg %player% Hey! You are making a strike of %strike% entities!" # You can put 2 variables, %player% and %strike% only
        executeAs: CONSOLE # You can execute commands as CONSOLE, PLAYER, and PLAYEROP
DEFAULT: # DEFAULT affects all entities that are not specifically configured. In this dafault example, 'CREEPER' has a different configuration, so it will use that one instead.
  # In this example, 'DEFAULT' has no 'maxTime' configured, so it will use the one set by 'ALL'
  killingALot: # Example name for this function
    minRequired: 3
    baseFunction: 2*y + x/50 # Multiplicates the base reward. x=strike (number of entities killed) y=Old base reward. For example, let's say the player has killed 7 Skeletons, and the base reward for a skeleton is 1.5: 2*1.5 + 7/50 => 3 + 0.14 => 3.14
CREEPER: # Affects ONLY creepers, overriding 'DEFAULT' configuration. It will still use any values in 'ALL'
  maxTime: 3500 # This will override the 'maxTime' in 'ALL' for this specific entity.
  defusingOne:
    maxRequired: 1 # The maximum number of creepers that will be affected by this function. In this case, only the first creeper of each strike will be affected.
    commands:
      anotherMsgSample:
        command: "msg %player% BOMB HAS BEEN DEFUSED"
        executeAs: CONSOLE
  defusingTooMuch:
    minRequired: 5
    baseFunction: 2*y # Base strike combo reward for creepers, activated after killing 5 or more.
  defusingMultiple:
    minRequired: 2
    commands:
      anotherMsgSample:
        command: "msg %player% ANOTHER BOMB HAS BEEN DEFUSED! You've been rewarded with a higher multiplicator!"
        executeAs: CONSOLE
      anotherCommand:
        command: "say I AM BRAVE! I've killed %strike% creepers all by myself!"
        executeAs: PLAYEROP
    multiplicatorFunction: 1 + x/10 # Multiplicates the reward for killing creepers (line 27). x=strike (number of creepers killed), y=user multiplier. This function is by default multiplied by 'y'.
    # Example: By default, for normal users y=1, so by killing 3 creepers, they'll be getting a '(1 + 3/10)*1 = 1.30' multiplier. And if base reward for a creeper is 2, then they'll normally be getting '2*3=6' as a reward. The 1.30 multiplier will increase the 6 reward, so they will get '6 * 1.30 = 7.8'
    # However, let's say that you have a special bonus for VIP users, and your VIP users have a 2 multiplier, so their y=2. In that case, their multiplier for killing 3 creepers would be '(1 + 3/10)*2 = 2.60'. So the reward of 6 will be multiplied by 2.60, and they will get '6 * 2.60 = 15.6'
    # If 'y' is not included in the function, it will automatically be assumed and multiply the function. If it is included, it won't. Examples: In the above example, '1 + x/10' becomes '(1 + x/10)*y'. However, if the function was, '1 + x/10 + 2y' it will stay like so, and not be changed to '(1 + x/10 + 2y)*y'
ZOMBIE:
  maxTime: 8000 # In this case, since the only function for Zombies is 'maxTime', it will still use the 'DEFAULT' configuration.
